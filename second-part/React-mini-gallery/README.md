## React Image Gallery

In this mini project, you are required to create an image gallery using React. The gallery should fetch a set of images from given api, limit the results to 20 images, and display them in a user-friendly Ul. Upon clicking on any photo, the user should be redirected to a single image view, where additional information, such as the title and description of the image, is shown.
Requirements:
• Create a new React application using create-react-app or any preferred React boilerplate.
• Implement a gallery component that displays the first 20 images fetched from the server. Each image should be displayed with a thumbnail and relevant details.
• Add functionality to handle user interaction. Clicking on any thumbnail in the gallery should redirect the user to a new page showing the single image in a larger view.
• On the single image page, display the enlarged image along with its title and description.
• Use React Router Dom to handle navigation between the gallery and single image view.
• Ensure error handling for cases where the server request fails or returns no images.

### Additional Notes:

• You are encouraged to use any external libraries or CSS frameworks if necessary. Popular libraries like axios for API requests
• Remember to structure your code appropriately into reusable components for maintainability.
• Provide clear and concise comments throughout your code to explain complex logic or functionality.
